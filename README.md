Tabs make less noise, giving more room to browse the web letting you see what’s important to prevent you from getting distracted. One file without surprises, as simple as you always wanted.

## :ninja: Protect Your Privacy

Works on top of Firefox, and [uBlock Origin works best on Firefox](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/uBlock-Origin-works-best-on-Firefox). Stops ads and trackers, so you can browse faster without being tracked. And when you’re using a slow or expensive internet connection, it lets you block scripts and images, so pages load faster and use less data.

## :gear: How To Install

### Inspiration

Inspired by [Min Browser](https://github.com/minbrowser/min). I wanted to bring the Min Browser experience closer to Firefox. Min is written entirely with CSS and JavaScript using Electron, and is open-source software.
